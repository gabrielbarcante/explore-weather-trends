# Explore Weather Trends
## Description
This is the first project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity. I will analyze the temperature trends in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, (where I live) to the overall global temperature trends. My goal will be to create a visualization, a line chart, and make some observations about the similarities and differences between both trends. To do this, I will calculate the moving averages and use these in the plot in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

## Files used
I will use the `table_Rio_De_Janeiro_Global.csv` dataset to do my analysis. This dataset was extract from the database in the SQL Workspace from Udacity, using [these queries](queries.sql).
